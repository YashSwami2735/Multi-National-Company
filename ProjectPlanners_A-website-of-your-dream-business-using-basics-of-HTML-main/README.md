# ProjectPlanners_A-website-of-Multi-National-Company-using-basics-of-HTML
This is an HTML code for a basic website consisting of a header, several sections, and a footer.
It includes a navigation menu, a banner, a section for products, a section for the team, a contact form, and copyright information.
It also includes a link to an external CSS stylesheet called "style.css" for styling the website.

It's important to note that this code is missing several elements that are commonly found in websites, such as meta tags for search engine optimization (SEO), links to external scripts for dynamic content, and accessibility features such as alt text for images.
It's also missing any actual content or functionality beyond basic HTML structure.
